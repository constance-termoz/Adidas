			<h1>Creativity</h1>
  		</div>
      <p>To apply, I loved the fact that a cover letter is not a condition sine qua none but that you suggest instead to send our best portfolio (...like on the site). It really appealed to my creativity (at least I hope so). And I really hope to join Adidas in order to continue (and also learn) to think out the box and feed my curiosity. </p>

			<h1>Confidence</h1>
  		</div>
      <p>The word means a lot to me as a sportswoman: this need to trust your teammates/team members is in my opinion the same as trusting your colleagues. But it also represents getting up after falling and learning from those mistakes. Among the three values of Adidas it is for this one that I have a crush and which expresses my motivation to be part of your team. </p>

			<h1>Collaboration</h1>
  		</div>
      <p>Finally, being part of a rugby team, working as a volunteer, take part in business challenges as a team, still travelling alone allowed me to go to others more easily and cultivated a team spirit.</p>

			<h1>Finally a kid's dream</h1>
  		</div>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">What fascinates me about Adidas is that it is not only one of the leading companies in the world of sport that makes us dream every day, but also the opportunity to be part of this group and convey these values! It's all about passion, and it's especially this motivation that I'd like to bring to your group !</p>
